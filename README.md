# Meteor React User Verification App
A React App with Meteor using Kadira's Flow Router and ReactLayout + Semantic UI.

This app is a simple proof of concept for me switching out Meteor's default Blaze template layer for Facebook's React. This has allowed me to take more of a web components style approach (similar to how it could be built using Google Polymer) which also made it much easier to structure.
